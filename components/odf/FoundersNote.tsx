						Take a pause, and reflect on life post-ChatGPT. Okay, a bit more specifically—reflect on its impact on B2B content marketing.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-3 text-slate-700">
						AI writing tools dramatically reduced barriers to churning out “good” content. There’s likely been more business blog content posted after Nov 2022 than all years prior. But none of us are solving for volume—we’re solving for share of voice and share of mind. When every blog reads the same, everyone blends into the background.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-3 text-slate-700">
						Meanwhile, B2B buyers increasingly use ChatGPT for recommendations and research. You now need to stand out to humans and AI.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-5 text-slate-800 font-medium">
						“How do I tell my unique and authentic story to capture buyer mindshare, in a way that works with both human and AI audiences?”
					</p>
					<p className="mt-5 text-slate-700">
						I’m Anish Bharadwaj, and before building products for marketers at Amazon and startups, I worked as an election strategist. I’m obsessed with storytelling that makes your story win. My cofounder, Raunak Bhandari, was an ML Lead at Google, closely involved in Knowledge Graphs and Gemini.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-3 text-slate-700">
						Together, we’re building KiwiQ AI to help B2B startups tell their story more effectively in this hybrid world. It’s not another AI writing tool—it’s intelligence infrastructure that remembers who you are and ensures you’re discoverable everywhere buyers look.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-3 text-slate-700">
						We believe this is a high‑impact problem worth solving. Next week, we’re launching our first product—ContentQ—and would love to learn your story.
